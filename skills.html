            This year has a been a big year for myself. I was coming into the first year coding with little to no
            experience with Html, and Css. West Mec has put many perspectives of coding experience in me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have become a very fluent coder with Html. I have learned the fundamentals and the basics of Html. I
            have the knowledge about Html. I know the proper ways to use the Html elements and the little tricks to
            Html.
        </p>
        <p>
            A skill that I am strong is is Css. I know the basics of Css. I try to explore the working place to gain
            more knowledge on the new tricks and different new ways Css can be applied. I am getting familiar the work
            place and how Css is applied in the workplace.
